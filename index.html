                The cheetah is a large cat that is the fastest land animal. It can run at speeds of 50 to 61 mph. Cheetahs have evolved adaptations for speed, long thin legs, and a long tail. Their long tail helps with balance and changing direction quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cheetahs are native to Africa, central Iran, and India.

            Why is that cheetah the fastest animal?
        </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Lightweight body: Cheetahs weigh between 80 and 140 lbs. Their lightweight bodies help them gain speed faster.</li>
            <li>Small head: Their small heads are designed for aerodynamics.</li>
            <li>Long legs: Their long legs are designed for aerodynamics.</li>
            <li>Flexible spine: Their flexible spine allows for extreme extension during the run.</li>
            <li>Semi-retractable claws: Their semi-retractable claws act like running spikes.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>I would run as fast as I can.</li>
            <li>I would eat as much as I can.</li>
            <li>I would sleep as much as I can.</li>
